  This is a cheat sheet for various helpful shortcuts supported by the AndroidStudio IDE.
  Keys in [brackets] are supposed to be held down during the command!

*   [Alt] + Enter:
      This shortcut allows you to open a context menu on almost
      everything, whether that be a Class, a Widget, an Error or a Warning,
      even Parameters etc.

*   [Ctrl] + Arrow-Keys || Del || Backspace:
      This allows you to skip over whole Words when navigating your code.
      It is especially useful when you have very long Statements.

*   [Ctrl + Shift] + Arrow-Keys:
      Similar to the shortcut above this allows you to highlight whole words
      and lines in one go.

*   Ctrl + [Ctrl] + Arrow-UP||Arrow-DOWN (or holding down & dragging the mouse  wheel):
      This allows you to create multiple Cursors in multiple lines.
      The Input from the Keyboard will be applied to all lines simultaneously.
      This is especially helpful when combined with the two above commands.

*   [Ctrl] + B:
      This jumps to the definition of whatever is underneath your cursor at
      the given moment. If it's a variable it will jump to the Point of
      declaration, if it's a Type/Class it will jump to the implementation of
      that class.

*   [Ctrl + Shift] + Backspace
			This will let your cursor jump to the last different Position it was
			inside the editor. Especially helpful when you changed something and
			immediately want to change it back, or if your files are longer than
			150 lines ;)
			If used multiple times in a row, it will alternate between the last and
			the current position.

*   [Shift] + F6:
			This allows you to refactor any sort of Identifier in your project.
			The identifier will be changed everywhere it is used in the project.

*   [Ctrl] + Space:
			This is AndroidStudios (and IntelliJ's) smart autocompletion.
			It can be used to show public members and methods of a class,
			to show the parameters of a Dart-Constructor and much more.
